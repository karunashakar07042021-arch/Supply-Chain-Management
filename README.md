# 📦 Supply Chain Management (SCM) – Power BI Project
# 📌 Project Overview

The Supply Chain Management Power BI Project focuses on analyzing and visualizing end-to-end supply chain operations to improve delivery performance, operational efficiency, and decision-making.

The dashboard integrates data related to orders, customers, salespersons, service channels, teams, and cities to provide real-time insights into On-Time In-Full (OTIF) performance. Using Power BI, raw transactional data is transformed into interactive visual reports that help identify bottlenecks, control delays, and enhance customer satisfaction.

# 🧩 Problem Statement
OTIF (On-Time In-Full) is a critical logistics metric measuring a supplier’s ability to deliver orders on time and in full quantity.
Using order, customer, salesperson, city, and delivery data, this project analyzes:
1.	OTIF performance over time
2.	Order delivery status trends
3.	Highest OTIF-performing entities
4.	Key influencers affecting delivery outcomes

# 📈 Advanced Analytics
# Descriptive Analysis

Summarizes delivery performance trends across all dimensions.

# Diagnostic Analysis

Identifies root causes such as:

Seasonal demand spikes

City-level logistics constraints

Checkout and scheduling congestion

Inconsistent team execution

# Predictive Analysis

Higher risk of late deliveries in Feb–Apr

Jurupa Valley likely to remain a delay hotspot

Certain customers consistently face delays

# Prescriptive Analysis

Reallocate resources during high-risk months

Optimize routes for delay-prone cities

Train salespersons linked to late deliveries

Implement alert systems for repeated delays
