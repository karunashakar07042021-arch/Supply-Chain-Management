# 📦 Supply Chain Management (SCM) – Power BI Project
📌 Project Title
Supply Chain Management Performance Analysis using Power BI
📖 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing end-to-end supply chain operations to improve delivery performance, operational efficiency, and decision-making. Using Excel and Power BI, raw transactional supply chain data is transformed into interactive dashboards that provide insights into On-Time In-Full (OTIF) performance, delivery status trends, and key operational bottlenecks.
The dashboard helps stakeholders monitor KPIs, evaluate delivery efficiency, identify risks, and implement data-driven improvements across procurement, logistics, and distribution processes.

# 🧩 Problem Statement
OTIF (On-Time In-Full) is a critical logistics metric measuring a supplier’s ability to deliver orders on time and in full quantity.
Using order, customer, salesperson, city, and delivery data, this project analyzes:
1.	OTIF performance over time
2.	Order delivery status trends
3.	Highest OTIF-performing entities
4.	Key influencers affecting delivery outcomes

#  📊 Analysis & Visualizations
#  Overall Delivery Performance
•	Early Deliveries: 58.64%
•	On-Time Deliveries: 19.84%
•	Late Deliveries: 21.53%
# Key Analysis Dimensions
•	Month-wise delivery trends
•	Salesperson & team performance
•	Customer repeat behavior
•	City-wise delivery efficiency
•	Service channel impact

# 🔍 Analytical Insights
# Descriptive Analysis
•	Early deliveries peak in May, July, March
•	On-time deliveries peak in May, July, February
•	Late deliveries peak in April, February, March
# Diagnostic Analysis
•	Seasonal demand spikes impact Q1–Q2 performance
•	Certain salespersons and teams are consistently linked to delays
•	Jurupa Valley and Oklahoma City show repeated delivery issues
# Predictive Analysis
•	Late deliveries likely to increase in Feb–Apr
•	High-risk customers identified based on historical delays
•	Performance instability expected without intervention
# Prescriptive Analysis
•	Reallocate resources during high-risk months
•	Optimize routes for delay-prone cities
•	Reduce checkout congestion (SM 02–04 time slots)
•	Provide targeted training for underperforming salespersons
