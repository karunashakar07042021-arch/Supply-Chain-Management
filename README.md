# Supply-Chain-Management
Use Case: Logistics
PROBLEM STATEMENT:
A logistics and supply chain company wants to make a dashboard for OTIF Analysis. On-time in-full (OTIF) is a supply chain metric for measuring performance in the logistics industry. OTIF generally refers to a supplier’s ability to deliver product within prescribed delivery windows and at full quantities ordered. OTIF was designed to improve store operations within TCI itself and quickly led to a series of major changes as it was quickly adopted by other retailers and companies. So they have given data which considers 4 sheets. They are Orders, Salesperson, Customer and City.
Expectations of Stakeholders are:-
1.	Make various KPIs.
2.	Explain the OTIF Performance over Time
3.	What is the Order delivery status over Time?
4 What are the Highest OTIF Performances?
4.	Do something with Key Influencers and other advanced visualizations.
