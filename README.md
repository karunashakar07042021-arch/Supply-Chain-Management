# 📦 Supply Chain Management (SCM) – Power BI Project
# 📌 Project Overview

The Supply Chain Management Power BI Project focuses on analyzing and visualizing end-to-end supply chain operations to improve delivery performance, operational efficiency, and decision-making.

The dashboard integrates data related to orders, customers, salespersons, service channels, teams, and cities to provide real-time insights into On-Time In-Full (OTIF) performance. Using Power BI, raw transactional data is transformed into interactive visual reports that help identify bottlenecks, control delays, and enhance customer satisfaction.
